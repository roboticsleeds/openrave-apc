# OpenRAVE Amazon Picking Challenge Environment
![APC Environment](images/openrave_apc.png "APC Environment")

A collection of Amazon Picking Challenge (APC) objects/products and the "Kiva Pod" (i.e the shelf used in the competition) for OpenRAVE. 

A Python script is also provided to create a simple randomise environment. Due to time constraints, the script is a quick solution of placing objects to different locations on the shelf, however is not perfect. Feel free to contribute and improve the code.

The script also provide a functionality to export a randomise environment to a static XML file.
